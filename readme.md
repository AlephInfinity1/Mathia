# Mathia Alpha v0.0.6

A command-lineâ€“like tool for mathematical operations.

## To-do

- [ ] Create a better algorithm of aggregating like terms for polynomials. (Remember to delete terms whose coefficient is 0!)
- [x] ~~Construction of a Polynomial using numbers doesn't work yet.~~ (Partially implemented with polyParseArray)
- [ ] Change toString() such that it does not display 1 coefficients, and displays negative numbers properly (i.e. 3 x^2 - 5 x instead of 3 x^2 + -5 x).
- [ ] Create a function to parse string into Polynomial.
- [ ] Modify polyDivide so that it displays the procedure line-by-line.
- [x] ~~Fix the issue with arithmetic operations (9+2-9 returning - as the result.)~~
- [ ] Commands def and rcl are functional now, but variables still cannot be used in calc.

## Future ideas

- [ ] Implement class Matrix, for matrix calculations.
- [ ] Cubic equations and quadratic equations, based on polynomials.
- [ ] Coming soon...
